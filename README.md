# csci2275-final-project
This is my final project for class CSCI 2275 - Programming and Data structures. The goal of this project is to simulate efficient vaccine distribution. The most populous cities receive the vaccines first. In this project I utilize two data structures that we learned about in class: a priority queue using a heap and a graph. 

The priority queue stores major cities in Colorado and orders them by population. The graph stores Colorado cities as vertices and uses weighted edges to represent distances between them. Prioritizing the most populous cities first, the program visits cities one by one until vaccines are distributed to all cities. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to calculate the shortest route between cities by distance. Alternatively, Breadth-first search is used to calculate the route with the least number of jumps.
